## 🎬 How It Works

```
User → Your Site → Eporner API → Video Embeds → User Watches
```

1. User visits your site
2. Your site calls Eporner's API
3. Eporner returns video data (title, thumbnail, embed URL)
4. Video plays using Eporner's official embed player
5. Eporner hosts everything, you just provide the interface

**Why This is Legal:**
- Eporner OFFICIALLY provides the API
- Eporner WANTS sites to embed their content
- It's documented at https://www.eporner.com/api/v2/
- Similar to how YouTube embeds work

---

## 💰 How to Make Money

You monetize with **ads around the embeds**.

### Step 1: Sign Up for Ad Networks

**ExoClick (Recommended):**
- Website: https://www.exoclick.com
- Sign up as Publisher
- Create banner ad zones
- Get zone IDs

**Other Options:**
- TrafficJunky: https://www.trafficjunky.com
- JuicyAds: https://www.juicyads.com

### Step 2: Add Ads to Your Site

1. Get your zone IDs from ad network
2. Add to `lib/config.ts`:
```typescript
adNetworks: {
  exoclick: 'YOUR_ZONE_ID_HERE',
}
```

3. Add ad code to your pages (see `EPORNER_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

### Step 3: Drive Traffic

- **SEO**: Optimize for keywords
- **Paid Ads**: Buy traffic from adult ad networks
- **Social**: Twitter/X, Reddit
- **Forums**: Adult webmaster communities

### Revenue Potential:

| Daily Visitors | Page Views | Revenue/Month* |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 1,000 | 2,000 | $120 |
| 10,000 | 20,000 | $1,800 |
| 50,000 | 100,000 | $12,000 |

*Assuming $3 CPM average (varies by traffic quality)
