   - Apply for the program
   - Get your affiliate ID (called "pkey")

2. **Add Your Affiliate ID**

   - Example: `affiliateId: 'abc123xyz'`

3. **Test Your Links**
   - Click "Watch on PornHub" on any video
   - Check the URL - should include `?pkey=YOUR_ID`

### Step 2: Add Real Content (Important!)

Currently using **sample/placeholder videos**. You need to:

2. **Copy video details:**
   - Video ID from URL (e.g., `viewkey=abc123`)
   - Title
   - Views, rating, duration
   - Take screenshot for thumbnail

3. **Add to your site:**
   - Open: `lib/api.ts`
   - Find the `SAMPLE_VIDEOS` array
   - Replace samples with real video data

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'ph-video-1',
  title: 'Actual Video Title from Pornhub',
  thumbnail: 'path/to/screenshot.jpg',
  duration: '12:34',
  views: 1500000,
  rating: 4.8,
  category: 'Featured',
  platform: 'pornhub',
  videoUrl: generateAffiliateLink('pornhub', '/view_video.php?viewkey=ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID'),
  uploadDate: '2024-10-26',
  tags: ['amateur', 'couple'],
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### `lib/config.ts` - Affiliate Configuration
This is where you add your affiliate IDs from each platform:

```typescript
export const AFFILIATE_CONFIG = {
  pornhub: {
    affiliateId: 'YOUR_PORNHUB_AFFILIATE_ID', // ⬅️ Add your ID here!
    trackingParam: 'pkey',
  },
  // ... other platforms
};
```

### `lib/api.ts` - Video Data
This is where you add your curated videos:

```typescript
const SAMPLE_VIDEOS: Video[] = [
  {
    id: 'unique-id',
    title: 'Video Title',
    // ... video details
  },
  // Add more videos here
];
```

---

## 💡 How the Affiliate System Works

### Traffic Flow:
1. **User visits your site** → Sees curated videos
2. **User clicks video** → Goes to video page
3. **User clicks "Watch on Platform"** → Redirects to original site
4. **Your affiliate ID is included** → Platform tracks the click
5. **User signs up or watches** → You earn commission! 💰

### Commission Examples:
- **Pornhub PPS**: $1-$50 per signup
- **Revenue Share**: 50-70% recurring
- **PPV**: $0.01-$0.05 per view

### Estimated Earnings:
- **100 clicks/day** → $3-$10/day
- **1,000 clicks/day** → $30-$100/day
